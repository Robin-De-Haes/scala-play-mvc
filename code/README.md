### user-pictures

The folder user-pictures contains all the images that are supposed to already be uploaded for the database posts.
In case you delete a post (and its related picture therefore gets deleted as well), 
you should copy this user-pictures folder into the public folder when restarting the application to ensure correct behavior.
